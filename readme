this is a simulation of the boids model
with twist 

the boids act like fireflies , thet blink on and off , and can sync up , and the way that they classify their neighbours is through voronoi classificatiion 

this was a project that i worked on a long time back but didnt upload the final version 
i  have uploaded one of the final versions now , you can play withit to see how birds flock and fireflies sync up 
i after making the simulation i kind of didnt do much with it for years 
but now im uploading a better version to keep things clean 
not as cool as the ising model sim 
but my first simulation 

the class that is defined contains the paramerters for almost averything in the simulation so change them and see if the boids flock or not , 
  it can be built upon to see the evolution of order parameter 
  and all that , to run it just copy and paste it into jupyter notebook , it should run just fine .
